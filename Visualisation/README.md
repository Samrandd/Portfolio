Global sales data
Connect to the Global Sales Data in your Exercise folder. This data needs to be cleaned up using the data interpreter. The data then needs to be pivoted, and the extra columns removed, and renamed to something more sensible. We then need to make a secondary connection to the World Indicators.tde file in your Exercise folder. We want to use a left join to pull over values that are in both sides of the tables.
We then want to create a bar chart showing the car sales, and any other measure that you choose.
