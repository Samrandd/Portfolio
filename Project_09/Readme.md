** Behavioral customer segmentation **

 Behavioral customer segmentation, particularly RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) analysis, is a critical method for understanding customer behavior by evaluating purchase patterns. 
The RFM model segments customers based on three key metrics:

Recency: This measures how recently a customer has made a purchase. A shorter period since the last purchase indicates higher engagement and customer loyalty.

Frequency: This metric assesses the number of purchases made within a specific timeframe, typically over the last 12 months. Higher frequency is an indicator of customer satisfaction and repeat business.

Monetary Value: This represents the total spending of a customer over a set period, often the last 12 months. It helps in identifying the most financially valuable customers.

Approaches to Grouping RFM Values

RFM values can be categorized using various methods, each offering unique insights:

Quantile-Based Segmentation: Customers are divided into groups of equal size based on percentile values for each RFM metric. This approach is useful for identifying top-performing segments across different behavioral dimensions.

Pareto 80/20 Approach: Assigns customers to either a high or low-value group based on the Pareto principle, which often reveals that a large proportion of revenue comes from a relatively small fraction of customers.

Custom Segmentation Based on Business Knowledge: Tailoring segmentation criteria to align with specific business objectives or industry standards. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior relevant to the business context.

Process of Calculating Percentiles

•	Sorting: Organize customers in ascending or descending order based on the chosen metric.

•	Grouping: Divide the sorted customer list into a pre-defined number of groups, ensuring each group has an equal number of customers.

•	Labeling: Assign labels to each group. The labeling criteria can vary; for instance, in Recency, lower values (more recent activity) are more favorable, so the labeling is inverse - the most recent purchases receive the highest scores.
