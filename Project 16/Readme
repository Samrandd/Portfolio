Problem Description
Project Overview

Employee turnover, also referred to as "employee churn," presents a significant financial challenge for businesses. The actual cost associated with replacing an employee can be substantial. According to Especially for IT service organizations, the rate at which employees leave, known as the churn rate, typically falls within the range of 12% to 15%. This rate is notably high. Even if we conservatively estimate a lower churn rate of 5%, the financial implications of an employee departing from the organization are substantial. It can be approximated that the cost incurred when an employee leaves a company amounts to about 1.5 times their annual salary (Saradhi and Palshikar 2011).

This financial burden is undoubtedly unwelcome news for organizations grappling with a high employee churn rate, also known as attrition. In essence, the expense of replacing employees remains a substantial burden for most employers due to factors such as the time invested in recruiting and selecting replacements, sign-on bonuses, and the subsequent loss of productivity during the transition period as the new employee adapts to their role.
Problem Statement

Gaining insight into the reasons behind employee departures and identifying when they are most likely to occur can inform strategies to enhance employee retention and facilitate proactive hiring planning. I will employ a systematic, step-by-step approach that can be applied to a variety of machine learning problems. This project aligns with the field commonly known as "HR Analytics" or "People Analytics."
In this research, we aim to address the following problem statement:

    How can we predict if active employee leaving the company?
    What are the primary indicators that an employee is on the verge of leaving the company?
    What policies or strategies can be implemented based on the findings to enhance employee retention?
    Since we have data on former employees, this project entails a standard supervised classification problem in which the label is a binary variable: 0 (active employee) and 1 (former employee). In this study, our target variable, denoted as Y, represents the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.
