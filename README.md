During my study at General Assembly I completed many projects which show my skill sets and understanding of machine learning, statistics, python, and practical application of Data Science methodologies to real world problems. The readme files serve as a primer to understanding the code and approach taken. All solutions can be found in the corresponding project's folder - labeled as that project's name.

Skills Showcased: Python | SQL | Tableau | Machine Learning | Web Scraping |  Pandas | NumPy | Linear & Logistic Regression modeling | Random Forests | NLP | Naive Bayes|KNN| Technical Writing
