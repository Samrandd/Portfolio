Project 13: Sales Analysis for Value Inc
Value Inc is a retail store that sells household items all over the world by bulk.

He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit and top selling products. He wants a
dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel sheet.
Need to clean and manipulate the data
